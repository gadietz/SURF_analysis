Subjects for which the Logistic Regression either predicted
the subject was always accuaracte or always inaccurate:
[29.0, 31.0, 44.0, 54.0, 56.0, 57.0, 59.0, 65.0, 66.0, 67.0, 68.0, 71.0]
Due to these models being biased to always pick the same end result,
they were excluded from further study of the participant models.

A T-test was conducted on the remaining subjects model accuracies
to see if there was strong evidence that the logistic regression
model accuracy was higher than random chance (50% accuracy)

Sample Size              : 68
Mean of Sample Accuracies: 0.6049
Standard Deviation       : 0.0581
P Value of T-Test        : 0.0213

Since the P-Value is less than 0.05, we can say these results
are significant, and therefore there is strong evidence that our
modeling technique predicts memory accuracy.
